    <h3>Daily Average Tip</h3>
    <p>We only included credit card transactions greater than $5 and less than $500, since there were a lot of really small and large transactions.
    When looking at only cash tips versus credit card tips, a very large discrepancy is noticed. This might be because cab drivers do not report
    cash tips. (Why the fuck would you?) For reference, the minimum tip average was $2.30 on 2/9/13 and the maximum tip average was $2.97 on 12/12/13.</p>
    <h4>Interesting points:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Lots of Saturday's and Sunday's have low tips.</li>
        <li></li>
