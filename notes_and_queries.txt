right now, we have:
---
1) heatmap showing # of rides in (1) neighborhood and (2) square

we should add on:
---
(optional) 2) Where do people start/go on Friday and Saturday nights?
    - pickups/dropoffs between friday 7pm-11pm and saturday 7pm-11pm
(optional) 3) Where do people end up on Friday and Saturday nights?
    - pickups/dropoffs between friday 11pm- saturday 4am and saturday 11pm-sunday 4am
4) neighborhood 1 to neighborhood 2 - avg tip percent, avg tip amount, avg fare

only credit cards, > $5, < $100
