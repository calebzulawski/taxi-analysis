# taxi-analysis
Small project to analyze NYC taxi data

## Setup
All data files are stored in /data/.  The CSVs are stored in /data/trip_data/ and /data/trip_fare/.

## Requirements
This project requires both Python 2 and 3.  This is due to the project being initially created in Python 3, but Google API modules only supporting Python 2.  For clarity:
* The **.py** extension refers to a **Python 3** program.  These may work in Python 2 but are untested for compatibility.
* The **.py2** extension refers to a **Python 2** program.  These will likely not work in Python 3 due to use of the Google API module.
